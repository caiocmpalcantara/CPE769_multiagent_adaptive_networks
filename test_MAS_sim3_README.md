# Multi-Agent Social Learning Test (test_MAS_sim3.m)

## Overview
This comprehensive test file validates the multi-agent social learning implementation in Agent2.m, addressing all critical implementation issues identified in the previous analysis.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Parameter Passing Issue
**Problem**: `General_Adapt_and_Fuse.apply()` used `addRequired('dim', ...)` expecting a positional argument, but `Agent2.social_learning_step()` passed `'dim', value` as name-value pairs.

**Fix**: 
- Modified `General_Adapt_and_Fuse.apply()` to use `addParameter('dim', ...)` instead of `addRequired`
- Added validation to ensure `dim` parameter is provided
- Updated test to pass `'dim', agents{a}.agent_technique.x_dim` as name-value pairs

### 2. Uninitialized fusion_technique Property
**Problem**: `Agent2.fusion_technique` was never set in the constructor, causing null pointer errors.

**Fix**:
- Added `fusion_tech` parameter to `Agent2` constructor with proper validation
- Modified test to explicitly set `fusion_technique` for each agent after creation
- Added safety checks in the test to verify fusion technique is set before use

### 3. Missing Agent ID Initialization
**Problem**: `Agent2.ID` property was declared but never initialized.

**Fix**:
- Added ID initialization in `Agent2` constructor using `randi(1000000)` for testing
- This enables proper agent identification in neighbor management

## Test Features

### Simulation Parameters
- Uses case 1 parameters from `test_kalman2.m`: `x_dim=3, y_dim=1, y_sd=0.2, u=[.1 .3 .7]', N=200`
- Creates 4 Agent2 instances with KF_diff technique
- Time-varying observation matrix H for realistic scenario

### Distributed Neighbor Management
- Each agent maintains its own neighbors list and weights (not centralized)
- Each agent includes itself in neighbors list (self-connection)
- Equal weighting: if agent has n neighbors, each weight = 1/n
- Weights always sum to 1.0
- Network topology:
  - Agent 1: connected to [1,2,3]
  - Agent 2: connected to [1,2,4]  
  - Agent 3: connected to [1,3,4]
  - Agent 4: connected to [2,3,4]

### Complete Social Learning Workflow
1. **Self-learning step**: Each agent performs individual Kalman filtering
2. **Social learning step**: Agents fuse information using `General_Adapt_and_Fuse`
3. **State tracking**: Monitors both individual and fused estimates
4. **Error analysis**: Compares performance before and after fusion

### Comprehensive Visualization
- **Figure 1**: 4-panel overview
  - Observations vs predictions
  - Individual vs fused state errors
  - Covariance trace evolution (uncertainty reduction)
  - State convergence for one agent
- **Figure 2**: Multi-agent comparison
  - All agents' error evolution
  - Consensus formation (x_1 component)
  - Prediction errors by agent
  - Final performance bar chart

### Performance Metrics
- Prediction error evolution
- State estimation error (individual vs fused)
- Consensus convergence analysis
- Uncertainty reduction through covariance trace
- Overall improvement percentage from social learning

## Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites
```matlab
addpath("./Technique/")
addpath("./Agent/")
addpath("./Technique/Kalman_inc/")
```

### Running the Test
```matlab
% Run the comprehensive test
test_MAS_sim3

% Or run the quick validation test first
test_fusion_fix
```

### Expected Output
- Console output showing agent creation, network setup, and simulation progress
- Performance metrics comparing individual vs fused estimates
- Two figures with comprehensive visualizations
- Summary of key findings including improvement percentage

## Key Validation Points

### 1. Parameter Passing Validation
```matlab
% This should now work without errors:
agents{a}.fusion_technique.social_learning_step(agents{a}, 'dim', agents{a}.agent_technique.x_dim);
```

### 2. Fusion Technique Initialization
```matlab
% Each agent should have a properly configured fusion technique:
assert(~isempty(agents{a}.fusion_technique))
assert(isa(agents{a}.fusion_technique, 'General_Adapt_and_Fuse'))
```

### 3. Social Learning Effect
- Agents should converge towards consensus
- Fused estimates should have lower error than individual estimates
- Covariance traces should decrease over time (uncertainty reduction)

## Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks around critical operations
- Graceful degradation if fusion fails (continues with individual estimates)
- Detailed error reporting with agent and time step information
- Safety checks for uninitialized fusion techniques

## Files Modified
1. `test_MAS_sim3.m` - Main comprehensive test file
2. `Technique/General_Adapt_and_Fuse.m` - Fixed parameter passing
3. `Agent/Agent2.m` - Added fusion_technique initialization and ID setting
4. `test_fusion_fix.m` - Quick validation test for the fixes

## Expected Results
- Social learning should improve overall performance
- Agents should reach consensus on state estimates
- Uncertainty (covariance trace) should decrease over time
- No runtime errors related to parameter passing or uninitialized properties

This test comprehensively validates that the multi-agent social learning system works correctly with all identified issues resolved.
